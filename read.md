Took a lot of inspiration from Pingers like: https://up.Coding398.dev and https://up.terminatorfishstudios.com, but made it with Flask

Also took inspiration from up.may-be.gay for the login page. I ended up making an entire system for it with repl owner checks etc. 

Took a lot of CSS from my other project: https://raadsel.is-a.dev

Used https://dillinger.io to create the FAQ pdf from Markdown
