<h1>How do I add my webserver to RDSL Pinger?</h1>
  
Well its pretty simple. Just follow this easy step-by-step tutorial
<br>**step 1**
> Go to [up.rdsl.ga](https://up.rdsl.ga). If you visit this site for the first time you will see this: ![login-page](https://cdn.rdsl.ga/Qx4Bcz.png)
> 
<br>**step 2**
> You now need to press login and a popup should show up. ![popup](https://cdn.rdsl.ga/1VdDf3.png)Press Authorize. This is completely safe and just verifies that you are you! <br>If instead of Authorize popup a Replit login page pops up. You have to login to Replit first to be able to use Replit Auth.

**step 3**
> Now you should be at the home page. ![home page](https://cdn.rdsl.ga/WT1UbT.png)
> In the input-bar you have to input a URL to your webserver. You can get this by going to the webview tab at your Replit and copy the URL ![Link](https://cdn.rdsl.ga/G0KmB4.png)
> Now press "Ping". It should load a bit (this can take a bit because it has to verify that it is a Repl, and that you are the owner.)
> Now you should get a alert. If it has been added to the Pinger you should see something like this ![This](https://cdn.rdsl.ga/PZhrn1.png). If something went wrong you should get a message with the error and how to fix it. Just follow those instructions!

<h1>How do I create a webserver?</h1>

To keep your Repl online you have to create a webserver to ping.
The code to create a webserver is different with each language so I will show a nodeJS example, and a Python example. If you are using Golang or another language you can just search for a webserver for that language [online](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/658/online)<!--For if you dont understand it:)-->.

<h3> NodeJS example:</h3>
There are 2 ways to create a webserver
The 1st (and the easiest) way:
Go to the shell and type `npm install replit-alive-server`
Now go to your main file and paste this somewhere: `require('replit-alive-server')();`.
It should start the webserver! <br><br>
The 2nd way:
Just paste this in the main js file you use.
```js
var http = require('http');  
http.createServer(function (req, res) {   
  res.write("I'm alive"); //You can change this text
  res.end(); 
}).listen(8080);
// Keep alive using up.rdsl.ga!
```
Now it should create a webserver!
<br>

--------

<h3> Python example</h3>
For python there are also 2 ways:<br>

The 1st (and easy way):
go to the shell and run `pip install replit-keep-alive==1.1.0`. Wait untill its done loading.
Now go to your main file and paste this code somewhere
```py
from replit_keep_alive import WaitressStart
WaitressStart()
```
Now you should have a webserver.<br><br>
The 2nd way (and harder way):
You need to create another file called `keep_alive.py` (name doesnt have to be like this specific)<br>
In that file paste this code:
<code>
from flask import Flask
from threading import Thread

app = Flask('')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "I'm alive!" #You can change this text

def run():
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0',port=8080) #localhost doesn't work, thats why it is 0.0.0.0

def keep_alive():  
    t = Thread(target=run)
    t.start()
# Keep alive using up.rdsl.ga!
</code>

Now go to your main py file and input this code somewhere
</code>
from keep_alive import keep_alive
keep_alive()
</code>
Now it should create a webserver!

## How does this work?
By defauly Repls aren't always online, but go offline after some time of no activity<br>
There are two ways to fix this. Either buy Hacker plan and use <a href="https://docs.replit.com/repls/always-on">Always On</a>, or create a webserver and use a pinger. (example for pinger: https://up.rdsl.ga. I've shown you 2 tutorials for Python and NodeJS, but the concept works for anything in any language.!
