# info
A not really light-weighted pinger. It works tough!
10 seconds countdown
+ awesome stats page & API
For me:
data/pings = allpings, goodpings, badpings, totalpings, time between pings

# Acknowledgements
Took a lot of inspiration for the front-end from Pingers like: [up.Coding398.dev](https://up.Coding398.dev) and [up.terminatorfishstudios.com](https://up.terminatorfishstudios.com). Also learnt about '<a href="https://zink.tips/">zink</a>' <!--Woah you can use <a href in markdown??? Didnt know that!-->there

Also took inspiration from [up.may-be.gay](https://up.may-be.gay) for the login page. I ended up making an entire system for it with repl owner checks etc. And that was stolen from my personal website project: [raadsel.is-a.dev](https://raadsel.is-a.dev)

Also took a lot of CSS from my other project: [raadsel.is-a.dev](https://raadsel.is-a.dev)

Used [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io) to create the FAQ pdf from Markdown
